Long description:
Gantt Chart is used for scheduling and management of task. While an ordinary Gantt Chart just displays the basic details like task id or name and their schedules, Gantt Chart by MAQ Software provides more details of the task by providing a grid where one can view more data related to the task and can display the hierarchy of data category. Also, data can be sorted based on any data point of the task.
For example, take case of project management, while other visuals will just provide project id/name, start time, end time and current status, this visual can provide additional details (data points) apart from the mentioned such as duration of project, owner of the project along with KPIs such as 'priority' etc. on a grid as separate columns inside the visual itself. Apart from additional information about the project, this visual let the user view project hierarchy (i.e.) tasks under any project and their progress. User can sort the project/task based on their data points as present on the grid column.
The visual lets you configure the detailing of information as per requirement. Other formatting features can represent information in a way that best tells the story of your data.
